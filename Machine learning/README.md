## Machine learning exercises and projects

In this repository, I regurlarly upload some machine learning tasks on classification and regression.

[K-Means clustering in Python](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee912/Deep-learning-projects/blob/master/Machine%20learning/ML7_K-Means%20clustering.ipynb)

- This notebook implements a K-Means algorithm for classification pertaining to a randomly generated dataset.
- A K-Means algorithm is also implemented for analysing customer segmentation.
