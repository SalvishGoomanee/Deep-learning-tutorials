## Supervised and unsupervised ML tasks in Python

In this repository, I regurlarly upload some machine learning tasks on classification and regression.

-----------------------------------------

[K-Means clustering in Python](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee912/Deep-learning-projects/blob/master/Machine%20learning/ML7_K-Means%20clustering.ipynb)

- This notebook implements a K-Means algorithm for classification pertaining to a randomly generated dataset.
- A K-Means algorithm is also implemented for analysing customer segmentation.

[Hierarchical clustering in Python](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee912/Deep-learning-projects/blob/master/Machine%20learning/ML8_Hierarchical%20clustering.ipynb)

- This notebook exposes the idea behind another unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely **hierarchical clustering**.
- The algorthim is implemented on a randomly generated dataset and on a vehicle dataset.
- The **agglomerative clustering algorithm** is studied in both tasks.

[The best classifier](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee912/Deep-learning-projects/blob/master/Machine%20learning/P6_The%20best%20classifier.ipynb)

- A very simple, yet interesting project for identifying the best supervised ML classifier in Python.
- The K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), the Decision Tree (DT), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Logistic Regression (LR) are implemented.
- Their respective performance pertaining to the task in question in reported at the end of the notebook.
- Note that an important portion of the code corresponds to analysing the data first which in itself is very useful.
