In this repository I upload various deep learning algorithms. 

[Keras regression based model](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee912/Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/Keras%20based%20regression%20model)

- Build a deep neural network in Python using the Keras library.
- Evaluation of the model performance on regression task by altering the training options.

[Machine learning](https://github.com/SalvishGoomanee/Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/Machine%20learning).

- Some elementary ML models and algorithms.
